A minimalistic 4x10 ortholinear low profile handwired keyboard

Aim of this keyboard is to be cheap and easy to make it yourself. 
You do not need to order any PCB or case for this. It also only has 40 keys, so besides tools, all you need to create this is:
 - 1x Elite-C microcontroller
 - 40x Kailh Low Profile Choc Switches
 - 40x Choc Low Profile Keycaps 
 - 40x 1N4148 diodes
 - 6x M2(2mm) spacers/standoffs 
 - 3D printed plate
 - Some solid core wire. Preferably 22-28 gauge

## 3D printing the plate
The plate is 182mm wide, 70mm long and 1.2mm high. You can download the stl file from the file list above.
